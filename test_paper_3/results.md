To demonstrate the principles of sonnet writing, this section presents annotated examples of both classic and original sonnets. Consider Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18,” which exemplifies the English sonnet’s structure: three quatrains and a final couplet, written in iambic pentameter (Shakespeare 64-65). The poem’s volta appears at line 9, marking a shift from admiration of the beloved’s beauty to the enduring power of poetry.

Original Example:

Shall I compare my verse to summer’s day?
It strives for warmth, for clarity, for light.
Yet words, unlike the sun, will never stay,
But fade as swiftly as the coming night.

Still, in this form, a fleeting truth is caught,
A moment’s grace preserved in measured line.
Though seasons change and memory comes to naught,
The sonnet’s shape endures by its design.

So let each rhyme and meter serve its part,
And let the volta turn the thought anew.
For in this art, both discipline and heart
Combine to make the old tradition true.

This original sonnet follows the English form, demonstrating the use of rhyme, meter, and thematic turn. Through such examples, writers can observe and practice the essential elements of sonnet construction.
