# Outline Index

This index lists the curated outlines available in the `outlines/` folder for use by Copilot and contributors. Outlines are organized by paper type and citation style. For each new style or paper type, add a new outline file and update this index.

## Available Outlines

- researchpaper_ieee_general.md — IEEE research paper (general)
- essay_ieee_general.md — IEEE essay (general)
- researchpaper_apa7_general.md — APA 7 research paper (general)
- essay_apa7_general.md — APA 7 essay (general)

## How to Use
- Copilot and contributors should select the most appropriate outline based on the requirements in `input_requirements.md`.
- If a more specific outline is needed (e.g., for a particular topic or journal), create a new outline file and add it to this index.

## Single-File Workflow Notice

Include all references in the References section of `paper.md`.

*This index should be kept up to date as new outlines are added to the project.*
