## LaTeX Output for Complex Mathematical Formulas

The repository now includes functionality to generate LaTeX output (`paper.latex`) alongside Word documents. This feature was added to preserve complex mathematical formulas that may not render optimally in Word format.

### Implementation Details

- The LaTeX output is generated automatically whenever the `convert_to_word.py` script is run
- The output file is named `paper.latex` and is saved in the same directory as the paper
- The conversion uses Pandoc's LaTeX format with full support for mathematical notation
- Both single-file and multi-file workflows are supported

### Benefits

- Preserves complex mathematical formulas with precise typesetting
- Allows for high-quality PDF generation through LaTeX compilers
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing workflow
- Particularly useful for papers with equations, statistical formulas, and mathematical proofs

### Usage

No additional steps are required to generate the LaTeX output. Simply run the conversion script as usual:

```
python convert_to_word.py <paper_folder>
```

This will generate both the Word document and the LaTeX file in the paper folder.

### Future Enhancements

- Consider adding LaTeX template options for different academic styles
- Explore options for direct PDF generation from the LaTeX output
- Add customization options for LaTeX output formatting
