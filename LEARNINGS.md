# Project Learnings & Best Practices

This document captures key learnings, optimizations, and troubleshooting insights from PaperCopilot development and usage.

## Export & Formatting (2025-05-15)

### Page Breaks in Word Export
**Issue**: Sections not starting on new pages in Word documents
**Solution**: 
- Insert `\pagebreak` or `\newpage` after each major section in Markdown
- Conversion script uses robust regex to handle variations (spaces, case differences)
- Converts to Pandoc DOCX raw XML: `<w:br w:type="page"/>`

**Validation checklist**:
- Markdown source contains correct page break tags
- Open exported file in Microsoft Word (not Google Docs)
- Verify Pandoc version is current
- Check section breaks appear correctly in final document

### APA 7 Reference Formatting
**Issue**: References formatted inconsistently, not APA 7 compliant
**Root Cause**: Previous templates used bullet points and incorrect ordering

**Solution implemented**:
- No bullet points or numbering in References section
- Strict alphabetical order by author surname  
- Hanging indent handled by Word export template
- Italicized book/journal titles with sentence case
- Double-spacing handled automatically

**Quality check**: All reference entries must be separate paragraphs in alphabetical order

## Workflow Optimization

### Single-File Approach Benefits
**Advantages discovered**:
- Simplified content management and version control
- Reduced file coordination complexity
- Easier reference management and citation tracking
- Streamlined export process with single source

**Implementation notes**:
- All content consolidated in `paper.md`
- References section included at end of same file
- Outlines updated to reflect single-file requirement
- Export scripts modified to process single source

### Outline-Driven Architecture
**Key insight**: Separating structure from style enables flexibility
**Benefits realized**:
- Easy addition of new paper types without style duplication
- Consistent application of citation styles across paper types
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Better collaboration between human and AI contributors

## Technical Implementation

### Pandoc Conversion Optimization
**Advanced Markdown features working**:
- Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Complex tables with merged cells
- Footnotes and endnotes
- Definition lists
- Smart punctuation and typography
- LaTeX math expressions

**Performance improvements**:
- Batch processing for multiple papers
- Template caching for faster repeated exports
- Error handling with clear user feedback
- Validation before export to prevent failures

### Template Management
**Template folder deprecation rationale**:
- All templates embedded in outlines for self-containment
- Reduced external dependencies
- Simplified maintenance and updates
- Better version control and consistency

## Quality Assurance

### Fact-Checking Process
**Effective validation methods**:
- Verify statistics against cited sources
- Check publication dates for currency
- Validate author credentials and affiliations
- Cross-reference claims with multiple sources
- Flag unsupported assertions

### Peer Review Optimization
**Most effective review areas**:
- Academic tone and professional language
- Logical argument flow and structure
- Citation accuracy and completeness
- Reference formatting consistency
- Research question clarity and answer

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Export Failures
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Missing sections error | Required sections not in paper.md | Check outline requirements, add missing sections |
| Citation formatting errors | Inconsistent citation style | Verify correct guideline file usage |
| Page break failures | Incorrect Markdown syntax | Use `\pagebreak` or `\newpage` exactly |
| Reference errors | Missing reference entries | Ensure all in-text citations have reference entries |

### Content Quality Issues
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Inconsistent academic tone | Mixed formal/informal language | Review entire document for consistency |
| Weak arguments | Insufficient evidence | Add more citations and supporting data |
| Poor flow | Logical gaps between sections | Add transitional paragraphs |
| Citation gaps | Missing source attributions | Fact-check all claims and add citations |
