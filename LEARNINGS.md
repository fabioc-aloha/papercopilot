# Project Learnings, Optimizations, and Failures

This file documents significant implementation learnings, optimizations, and failures. Update this file regularly to support continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.

## 2025-05-14: Workflow Execution for Test Paper (Market Research Best Practice)
- Initiated the workflow for the test paper as a process evaluation.
- Step 1: Confirmed that `input_requirements.md` is present and clearly defines the research goals and requirements for a paper on market research best practices.
- Step 2: Began with `literature_review.md` as the first chapter, in line with the workflow. Noted that starting with the literature review helps clarify the research landscape and informs the direction of subsequent chapters.
- Step 3: Confirmed that all other chapter files (`introduction.md`, `methods.md`, `results.md`, `discussion.md`, `conclusion.md`) are present and ready for drafting, using insights from the literature review.
- Step 4: Verified that `references.md` exists and is ready to be populated with fact-checked, APA 7 formatted citations as the paper is developed.
- Step 5: Checklist and peer review steps are in place but not yet executed, as content is not yet drafted.
- Step 6: Assembly and export process is documented in `WORKFLOW.md` and ready for use once chapters are complete.
- Step 7: Final validation steps are clear and enforce folder/content integrity.
- Key learning: The workflow enforces a logical, modular, and academically rigorous process. Starting with the literature review is especially effective for research-driven papers. The modular file structure and checklist support quality and compliance.

## 2025-05-14: Reference Consolidation and Template Update
- Implemented a new policy requiring all references to be consolidated in a single, alphabetized `references.md` file for each paper.
- Removed reference lists from all individual chapter files and updated all chapter templates, GUIDELINES.md, and WORKFLOW.md to reflect this change.
- This update improves compliance with APA 7, streamlines the assembly/export process, and reduces redundancy and errors in reference management.
