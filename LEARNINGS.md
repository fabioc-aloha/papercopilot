# Project Learnings and Best Practices

## Multiple Document Format Conversions

The repository now includes functionality to generate multiple document formats for each paper, allowing users to compare different renderings and choose the most appropriate one for their needs.

### Implementation Details

- When running the `convert_to_word.py` script, three output files are now generated:
  1. A Word document (`.docx`) generated from the Markdown source
  2. A LaTeX document (`paper.latex`) for preserving complex formulas
  3. A second Word document (with suffix `_latex.docx`) generated from the LaTeX source
- The LaTeX-to-Word conversion preserves formatting as accurately as possible using Pandoc
- The conversion uses the same reference document template for consistent styling

### Benefits

- Provides multiple rendering options for the same content
- Particularly useful for comparing how complex mathematical formulas are rendered
- Allows users to choose the format that best preserves their specific content
- Maintains consistent styling across all output formats

### Usage

Simply run the conversion script as usual:

```
python convert_to_word.py <paper_folder>
```

This will generate all three output files in the paper folder. Compare the two Word documents to identify any differences in formatting, especially for complex mathematical formulas or specialized content.

### Future Enhancements

- Consider adding visual comparison tools for the different outputs
- Add customization options for controlling which outputs are generated
- Implement more specific format optimizations based on content type

## LaTeX Output for Complex Mathematical Formulas

The repository now includes functionality to generate LaTeX output (`paper.latex`) alongside Word documents. This feature was added to preserve complex mathematical formulas that may not render optimally in Word format.

### Implementation Details

- The LaTeX output is generated automatically whenever the `convert_to_word.py` script is run
- The output file is named `paper.latex` and is saved in the same directory as the paper
- The conversion uses Pandoc's LaTeX format with full support for mathematical notation
- Both single-file and multi-file workflows are supported

### Benefits

- Preserves complex mathematical formulas with precise typesetting
- Allows for high-quality PDF generation through LaTeX compilers
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing workflow
- Particularly useful for papers with equations, statistical formulas, and mathematical proofs

### Usage

No additional steps are required to generate the LaTeX output. Simply run the conversion script as usual:

```
python convert_to_word.py <paper_folder>
```

This will generate both the Word document and the LaTeX file in the paper folder.

### Future Enhancements

- Consider adding LaTeX template options for different academic styles
- Explore options for direct PDF generation from the LaTeX output
- Add customization options for LaTeX output formatting
