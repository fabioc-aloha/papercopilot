# ABNT Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) style for this project.

## Structure
- Use a logical structure: cover page, abstract (resumo), summary (sumário), introduction, development (desenvolvimento), conclusion, references (referências), and appendices if needed.
- Each section should start on a new page in the final export.
- The cover page must include the institution, author, title, city, and year (centered, uppercase).

## In-Text Citations
- Use the author-date system: (SOBRENOME, year, page) for direct quotes, e.g., (SILVA, 2020, p. 15).
- For indirect citations, use (SOBRENOME, year).
- For multiple authors, separate names with a semicolon: (SILVA; SOUZA, 2020).
- For three or more authors, use the first author followed by "et al.": (SILVA et al., 2020).

## References (Referências)
- All sources cited in the text must appear in the reference list, and vice versa.
- List references alphabetically by author surname.
- Use a hanging indent for each entry (handled in Word export).
- Format examples:
  - Book: SOBRENOME, Name. Title: subtitle. Edition. City: Publisher, year.
  - Journal Article: SOBRENOME, Name. Title of article. Title of Journal, city, volume, issue, page range, month year.
  - Website: SOBRENOME, Name. Title of page. Site name, year. Available at: URL. Accessed on: day month year.
- Use uppercase for author surnames.
- Titles of books and journals in italics (handled in Word export).
- Include all required publication details.

## Formatting
- Use A4 paper, 2.5 cm margins (top, bottom, left), 2 cm (right).
- Use Times New Roman or Arial, size 12 for text, 10 for footnotes.
- Double-space the main text; single-space footnotes and references.
- Paragraphs should be indented 1.25 cm.
- Page numbers in the upper right corner, starting from the introduction.
- Section headings in bold, uppercase, and left-aligned.

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
