# PaperCopilot Robustness Improvements

This document outlines the robustness features implemented in PaperCopilot to ensure reliable operation and better error handling.

## Error Handling and Logging

The system now includes a centralized logging module that provides:

- Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Colored terminal output for better readability
- Optional file logging with comprehensive details
- Structured exception handling for critical operations
- Clear error messages with potential solutions

To use the logger in your code:

```python
from logger import log

# Various log levels
log.debug("Detailed information for debugging")
log.info("General information about operation")
log.warning("Warning that something might be wrong")
log.error("Error occurred but execution can continue")
log.critical("Critical error that requires immediate attention")

# Logging with exception information
try:
    # risky operation
    raise ValueError("Example error")
except Exception as e:
    log.exception(f"An error occurred: {e}")  # includes stack trace
```

## Configuration Management

A centralized configuration system manages all settings:

- Default values for all settings
- Configuration file support (papercopilot_config.json)
- Path resolution for templates, outlines, and reference files
- Validation of settings at runtime

The configuration can be used as follows:

```python
from config import config, get_path

# Get configuration values with defaults
pandoc_path = config.get('conversion', 'pandoc_path', 'pandoc')
enable_latex = config.get('conversion', 'enable_latex', True)

# Get resolved absolute paths
templates_dir = get_path('templates')
```

## Dependency Management

A dependency checker ensures all required tools and libraries are available:

- Verification of Python version
- Check for required Python modules with version constraints
- Validation of external tools like Pandoc
- Detailed reports of missing or incompatible dependencies

To check dependencies:

```python
from dependencies import dependency_checker

# Check all dependencies
if dependency_checker.check_all_dependencies():
    print("All dependencies are installed correctly")
else:
    print("Some dependencies are missing or have incorrect versions")
    print(dependency_checker.get_dependency_report())
```

## Testing Framework

The repository now includes automated tests to verify functionality:

- Unit tests for core features
- Configuration validation tests
- Dependency checking tests
- Mocked tests for file operations

Run the tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Professional Terminal Output

Terminal outputs have been improved for clarity and professionalism:

- Consistent formatting for all messages
- Color coding for different message types
- Clear error messages with actionable information
- Progress reporting for long-running operations

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

- More comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests with actual document conversion
- Command-line interface improvements
- More detailed documentation and examples
