# WORKFLOW.md

## Template Folder Deprecation (May 2025)
- All outlines in `outlines/` are now fully self-contained and do not require or reference any files from the `template/` folder.
- All section instructions and content guidance are embedded directly in the outlines.
- The `template/` folder is no longer required for any workflow, automation, or content generation.
- You may safely delete the `template/` folder after confirming all custom content has been migrated to the outlines.

## Version 2: Outline-Driven, Style-Agnostic Workflow (2025+)
- All automation and Copilot workflows use outline selection logic instead of hardcoded chapter selection.
- Each paper or essay type is defined by a style-agnostic outline in outlines/ (e.g., researchpaper_general.md, essay_general.md). Outlines specify only the canonical structure (order and names of required/optional sections).
- All style, citation, and formatting rules are enforced by the corresponding file in guidelines/ (e.g., ieee.md, apa7.md). Outlines never include style rules.
- The automation and assembly scripts use the selected outline to determine which section files to assemble and in what order, ensuring flexibility and style-agnostic structure.
- Contributors (human and AI) must never hardcode style rules in outlines/ or templates/.
- All documentation, templates, and scripts have been updated to reflect this logic. See README.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md for details.
- To-do: Expand outlines/ to support additional popular academic structures (see DECISIONS.md for the list).

## PDF Export Workflow (May 2025)
- The repository no longer includes a direct Markdown-to-PDF script. To generate a PDF, first use `convert_to_word.py` to create a `.docx` file, then open the file in Microsoft Word and use "Save as PDF".
- This approach ensures that all page breaks, formatting, and style requirements are preserved exactly as in the Word document.
- For documents with complex mathematical formulas, a LaTeX output (`paper.latex`) is automatically generated alongside the Word document, which can be used with a LaTeX compiler for high-quality PDF generation.

## Multiple Format Conversion (2025+)
- The conversion script now generates multiple output files for each paper:
  1. A Word document (`.docx`) generated from the Markdown source
  2. A LaTeX document (`paper.latex`) for preserving complex formulas
  3. A second Word document (with suffix `_latex.docx`) generated from the LaTeX source
- This allows users to compare the different renderings and choose the most appropriate one based on their needs.
- If mathematical formulas or complex formatting is critical, users can compare both Word outputs to determine which better preserves their content.
- To generate all three files, simply run: `python convert_to_word.py <paper_folder>`

## Page Break Handling
- Page breaks in Markdown (`\pagebreak` or `\newpage`) are automatically converted to DOCX-compatible page breaks using Pandoc's raw XML (`<w:br w:type="page"/>`).
- This ensures that each major section starts on a new page in both the Word and exported PDF documents.

### Structure vs. Style
- **outlines/**: Provides the canonical order and required/optional sections for each paper/essay type. Outlines are style-agnostic and do not contain formatting or citation rules.
- **guidelines/**: Enforces all style-specific requirements, including section naming, formatting, citation, and reference style. Each guidelines file corresponds to a citation style (e.g., ieee.md, apa7.md).
- **templates/**: Contains Pandoc LaTeX templates for each supported style, used for PDF/Word export.

### Workflow Steps
1. **Identify Requirements**
   - Read `input_requirements.md` to determine paper/essay type and citation style.
2. **Select Outline**
   - Use the appropriate outline from `outlines/` for structure.
3. **Apply Guidelines**
   - Use the corresponding file in `guidelines/` to enforce all style rules.
4. **Content Generation**
   - For each section in the outline, generate content using the embedded instructions in the outline, ensuring compliance with the selected style.
5. **Assembly and Export**
   - Assemble the document in the order specified by the outline, applying all style rules from the guidelines file.
   - Export to .docx and LaTeX using the conversion script (`convert_to_word.py`).
   - The LaTeX output (`paper.latex`) preserves complex mathematical formulas.
   - No table of contents is generated by default; explicit pagination is handled via `\pagebreak` tags in markdown, converted to `\newpage` in LaTeX.

### Notes
- Never hardcode style rules in outlines/ or templates/.
- All style enforcement must reference the appropriate guidelines/ file.
- Document all workflow changes in `LEARNINGS.md` and `DECISIONS.md`.
- All contributors and automation must follow these rules for every academic writing task to ensure compliance, reliability, and publication-ready output.
