# Academic Paper Workflow Guide

This document describes the complete workflow for creating academic papers using the PaperCopilot system.

## Overview

The PaperCopilot workflow is built on three core principles:
1. **Outline-driven structure**: Paper organization defined by outlines in `outlines/`
2. **Style-agnostic content**: Structure separate from formatting rules
3. **Single-file approach**: All content consolidated in `paper.md`

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize New Paper
```
initiate [folder_name] with [requirements]
```
This creates:
- `input_requirements.md` - Paper specifications
- `paper.md` - Main content file  
- `CHECKLIST.md` - Quality control checklist
- `outline.md` - Copy of selected outline

### 2. Generate Content
```
create content
```
Generates all sections based on selected outline and requirements.

### 3. Review & Refine
```
peer review [folder_name]
fact-check [folder_name]
```
Ensures academic quality and factual accuracy.

### 4. Export Final Document
```
save to word
```
Creates publication-ready Word document with proper formatting.

---
   - For each section in the outline, generate content using the embedded instructions in the outline, ensuring compliance with the selected style.
5. **Assembly and Export**
   - Assemble the document in the order specified by the outline, applying all style rules from the guidelines file.
   - Export to .docx or PDF using the conversion script (`convert_to_word.py`).
   - No table of contents is generated by default; explicit pagination is handled via `\pagebreak` tags in markdown, converted to `\newpage` in LaTeX.
6. **Finalize Checklist:**
    - Mark all items in `CHECKLIST.md` as complete.
7. **Final Submission:**
    - Confirm the paper is ready for submission or export, and perform the final submission step as required by your workflow or repository guidelines.
8. **Configure Export Script:**
    - Ensure conversion scripts process the correct folder.

### Notes
- Never hardcode style rules in outlines/ or templates/.
- All style enforcement must reference the appropriate guidelines/ file.
- Document all workflow changes in `LEARNINGS.md` and `DECISIONS.md`.
- All contributors and automation must follow these rules for every academic writing task to ensure compliance, reliability, and publication-ready output.

## Recursive Section Structure for Case Studies and Similar Sections

If your paper includes multiple case studies (or other repeated section types), each section should be structured using the relevant template and guidelines (e.g., Title, Description, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion for case studies). This ensures consistency and standards compliance for all repeated sections.

When drafting or reviewing outlines, always check for sections that represent repeated units (such as case studies, experiments, or profiles) and apply the appropriate template recursively within those sections.

---

## 3. Key Commands

- **convert_to_word**: Convert the Markdown file to a Word document using Pandoc.
- **initiate [folder] with [requirements]**: Create the folder if it does not exist, then set up the paper with all required files and select the outline. No need to create a workspace or perform any additional setup beyond preparing the necessary templates for the paper.
- **create content**: Generate all required sections using the selected outline and requirements.
- **review content**: Review for academic quality and compliance. Subcommands: `review section [name]`, `review references`, `review checklist`.
- **dive [section name]**: Provide a detailed breakdown or critique of a section.
- **checklist**: Display or update the completion checklist.
- **show outline**: Show the structure and instructions from the selected outline.
- **show requirements**: Show the current `input_requirements.md`.
- **save to word**: Assemble and export as `.docx` with all style requirements.
- **peer review [folder]**: Perform a comprehensive peer review of the paper in the specified folder. This includes:
    - Ensuring the paper does not mention templates, workflow, or methodology.
    - Verifying all in-text citations have corresponding entries in the References section.
    - Alphabetizing the References section.
    - Ensuring the research question is clearly stated and answered.
    - Improving academic tone, flow, and quality throughout.
    - Acting as a peer reviewer to provide publication-ready content.
- **professor [folder]**: Perform a rigorous academic evaluation of the paper in the specified folder, acting as a professor. This includes:
    - Assigning a grade based on academic rigor and quality.
    - Providing detailed observations and recommendations for improvement.
    - Saving the evaluation as `Professor.md` in the paper folder.
- **fact-check [folder]**: Perform a comprehensive fact-check of the paper in the specified folder. This includes:
    - Verifying all figures, statistics, and claims mentioned in the paper against the cited sources.
    - Checking the legitimacy and credibility of all references in the References section.
    - Flagging any unsupported, outdated, or questionable claims or sources.
    - Providing a summary report of fact-checking results and recommendations for corrections or improvements. The output is saved as `fact_check.md` in the paper folder.

- **submit [folder] to [publication]**: Submit the paper in the specified folder to the named journal or publication. This includes:
    - Evaluating if the target publication is a good fit for the paper’s topic, structure, and quality.
    - Providing a diagnostic on the likelihood of acceptance and rationale (e.g., scope match, style, novelty, rigor).
    - Saving the evaluation as `[publication].md` in the paper folder, so users can test multiple publication possibilities.

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Setup

#### Input Requirements (`input_requirements.md`)
Define your paper specifications:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Type**: Research paper, essay, report, etc.
- **Objective**: Purpose and scope of the paper
- **Required Sections**: List of sections needed
- **Style**: Citation style (APA, IEEE, MLA, etc.)
- **Notes**: Any special requirements

#### Outline Selection
The system automatically selects the appropriate outline based on:
- Paper type (research paper vs essay)
- Academic discipline (STEM, humanities, social sciences)
- Structural requirements (IMRaD, case study, literature review)

### Phase 2: Content Development

#### Section Generation
Each section is created following:
- **Structure**: From selected outline
- **Style**: From corresponding guideline file
- **Quality**: Academic tone and professional standards
- **Citations**: Proper in-text citations with references

#### Content Quality Standards
- **Academic rigor**: Evidence-based arguments
- **Professional tone**: Formal, objective writing
- **Proper citations**: Style-compliant referencing
- **Logical flow**: Clear progression of ideas
- **Fact-checking**: Verified claims and statistics

### Phase 3: Review & Validation

#### Peer Review Process
- Comprehensive content review
- Citation verification
- Reference alphabetization
- Academic tone assessment
- Structural compliance check

#### Quality Checklist
Before export, verify:
- [ ] All required sections complete
- [ ] In-text citations have reference entries
- [ ] References properly formatted
- [ ] Academic tone maintained
- [ ] Facts and statistics verified
- [ ] Proper page breaks inserted
