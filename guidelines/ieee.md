# IEEE Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in IEEE style for this project.

## Structure
- Use a logical structure: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, and references.
- Title page may be required (check your institution's requirements).
- Each major section should begin on a new page in the final export (handled by the export script).
- After each major section in your markdown, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) to ensure a page break in the exported Word document.

## In-Text Citations
- Use numbered citations in square brackets: [1], [2], etc.
- Each number corresponds to a reference in the reference list.
- For multiple citations: [1], [2], [3].

## Reference List
- List all sources cited in the text in the order they appear.
- Use a hanging indent for each entry (handled in Word export).
- Format examples:
  - Journal Article: J. Smith, "Title of article," *Journal Name*, vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 45-67, 2020.
  - Book: J. Smith, *Title of Book*, City: Publisher, 2020.
  - Website: J. Smith, "Title of page," Website Name, Year. [Online]. Available: URL
- Italicize book and journal titles (handled in Word export).

## Formatting
- Single-space the reference list; double-space the main text.
- Use 1-inch margins on all sides.
- Use Times New Roman 10pt or 12pt font.
- Include page numbers in the header or footer.
- To force a page break in the exported Word document, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) after any section that should start on a new page.

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
