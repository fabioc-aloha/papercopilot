# Harvard Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in Harvard style for this project.

## Structure
- Use a logical structure: introduction, body, conclusion, and reference list.
- Title page may be required (check your institution's requirements).
- Each major section should begin on a new page in the final export (handled by the export script).
- After each major section in your markdown, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) to ensure a page break in the exported Word document.

## In-Text Citations
- Use author-date style: (Smith, 2020).
- For direct quotes, include page numbers: (Smith, 2020, p. 15).
- For multiple authors: (Smith & Jones, 2020) or (Smith et al., 2020) for three or more.

## Reference List
- List all sources cited in the text in a reference list, alphabetized by author surname.
- Use a hanging indent for each entry (handled in Word export).
- Format examples:
  - Book: Smith, J. (2020) *Title of Book*. Publisher.
  - Journal Article: Smith, J. (2020) 'Title of Article', *Journal Name*, 12(3), pp. 45-67.
  - Website: Smith, J. (2020) 'Title of Webpage', Website Name, available at: URL (Accessed: 14 May 2025).
- Italicize book and journal titles (handled in Word export).
- Use sentence case for article and webpage titles.

## Formatting
- Double-space all text, including reference list.
- Use 1-inch margins on all sides.
- Use Times New Roman 12pt or Arial 11pt font.
- Include page numbers in the header or footer.
- To force a page break in the exported Word document, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) after any section that should start on a new page.

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
