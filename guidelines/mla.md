# MLA Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in MLA (Modern Language Association) style for this project.

## Structure
- Use a clear, logical structure: introduction, body, conclusion.
- Each major section should begin on a new page in the final export (handled by the export script).
- After each major section in your markdown, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) to ensure a page break in the exported Word document.
- Include a Works Cited page at the end.
- No title page required unless specified; include your name, instructor, course, and date on the first page (left-aligned).

## In-Text Citations
- Use author-page style: (Smith 23).
- For multiple authors: (Smith and Jones 45) or (Smith et al. 67) for three or more.
- For indirect sources, use "qtd. in": (qtd. in Jones 77).

## Works Cited
- List all sources cited in the text in a Works Cited page, alphabetized by author surname.
- Use a hanging indent for each entry (handled in Word export).
- Format examples:
  - Book: Smith, John. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Year.
  - Journal Article: Smith, John. "Title of Article." *Journal Name*, vol. 12, no. 3, 2020, pp. 45-67.
  - Website: Smith, John. "Title of Webpage." Website Name, Publisher, Date, URL.
- Italicize book and journal titles (handled in Word export).
- Use headline-style capitalization for titles.

## Formatting
- Double-space all text, including Works Cited.
- Use 1-inch margins on all sides.
- Use Times New Roman 12pt font.
- Indent new paragraphs one-half inch.
- Include page numbers in the header, right-aligned, with your last name.
- To force a page break in the exported Word document, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) after any section that should start on a new page.

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
