# APA 7 Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in APA 7 style for this project.

## Structure
- Use the IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) unless otherwise specified.
- Each major section should begin on a new page in the final export (handled by the export script).
- After each major section in your markdown, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) to ensure a page break in the exported Word document.
- Include a title page and abstract, each on a separate page.

## In-Text Citations
- Use author-date citation style (e.g., Smith, 2020).
- For direct quotes, include page numbers (e.g., Smith, 2020, p. 15).
- For group authors, spell out the full name (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration).
- For works with three or more authors, use the first author followed by "et al." after the first citation.

## References
- List all sources cited in the text in the References section.
- Do not use bullet points or numbering; each entry should be a separate paragraph.
- List entries in strict alphabetical order by author surname.
- Use a hanging indent for each reference entry (handled in Word export).
- Italicize book and journal titles; use sentence case for titles.
- Double-space all entries (handled by Word export).
- Example:
  
  Smith, J. A. (2020). *Title of the book in sentence case* (2nd ed.). Publisher.

## Formatting
- Double-space all text, including references.
- Use 1-inch margins on all sides.
- Use a standard, readable font (e.g., Times New Roman 12pt, Arial 11pt).
- Include page numbers in the top right corner.
- Include a running head on the title page and all subsequent pages.
- Use APA 7 section headings (centered, bold, title case for main sections).
- To force a page break in the exported Word document, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) after any section that should start on a new page.

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
