# APA 7 Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in APA 7 style for this project.

## Structure
- Use the IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) unless otherwise specified.
- Each major section should begin on a new page in the final export (handled by the export script).
- Include a title page and abstract, each on a separate page.

## In-Text Citations
- Use author-date citation style (e.g., Smith, 2020).
- For direct quotes, include page numbers (e.g., Smith, 2020, p. 15).
- For group authors, spell out the full name (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration).
- For works with three or more authors, use the first author followed by "et al." after the first citation.

## References
- All sources cited in the text must appear in the reference list, and vice versa.
- List references alphabetically by author surname.
- Use a hanging indent for each reference entry (handled in Word export).
- Format references as follows:
  - Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of the article. *Journal Name*, volume(issue), page range. https://doi.org/xxx
  - Group Author. (Year). Title of report. https://www.example.com
- Journal and book titles are italicized (handled in Word export).
- Use sentence case for article, book, and report titles.
- Include DOIs or URLs when available.

## Formatting
- Double-space all text, including references.
- Use 1-inch margins on all sides.
- Use a standard, readable font (e.g., Times New Roman 12pt, Arial 11pt).
- Include page numbers in the top right corner.
- Include a running head on the title page and all subsequent pages.
- Use APA 7 section headings (centered, bold, title case for main sections).

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
