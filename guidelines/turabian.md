# Turabian Academic Writing and Formatting Guidelines

This document provides authoritative rules for writing, structuring, and formatting academic content in Turabian style for this project.

## Structure
- Use a logical structure: title page, contents, introduction, body, conclusion, bibliography.
- Title page should include the paper title, your name, course, and date (centered, double-spaced).
- Each major section should begin on a new page in the final export (handled by the export script).
- After each major section in your markdown, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) to ensure a page break in the exported Word document.

## In-Text Citations
- Use footnotes or endnotes for citations (not parenthetical author-date style).
- Each source cited in the text must have a corresponding note.
- Notes should be numbered consecutively throughout the paper.
- Example footnote: 1. John Smith, *Title of Book* (City: Publisher, Year), page number.

## Bibliography
- List all sources cited in the text in a bibliography at the end of the paper.
- Arrange entries alphabetically by author surname.
- Use a hanging indent for each entry (handled in Word export).
- Format examples:
  - Book: Smith, John. *Title of Book*. City: Publisher, Year.
  - Journal Article: Smith, John. "Title of Article." *Journal Name* volume, no. issue (Year): page range.
  - Website: Smith, John. "Title of Webpage." Website Name. Last modified Month Day, Year. URL.
- Italicize book and journal titles (handled in Word export).
- Use headline-style capitalization for titles.

## Formatting
- Double-space the main text; single-space footnotes/endnotes and bibliography entries.
- Use 1-inch margins on all sides.
- Use Times New Roman 12pt font.
- Include page numbers in the header or footer.
- Indent new paragraphs.
- Use section headings as appropriate for your discipline.
- To force a page break in the exported Word document, insert a line with `\\pagebreak` (or `\\newpage`) after any section that should start on a new page.

## Additional Requirements
- Fact-check all statements and support them with credible, up-to-date sources.
- Ensure all content is professional, clear, and suitable for academic publication.
- Review and revise each section for clarity, coherence, and adherence to these guidelines before peer review.
