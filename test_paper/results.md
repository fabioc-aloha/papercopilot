The review identified several best practices widely recognized in contemporary market research. First, the adoption of mixed-methods research designs has become standard for achieving comprehensive and reliable insights (Creswell & Creswell, 2018; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010). Researchers increasingly combine qualitative techniques, such as interviews and focus groups, with quantitative surveys and big data analytics to capture both depth and breadth in consumer understanding.

Second, ethical considerations are now central to market research practice. The implementation of data privacy regulations, such as the GDPR, has led to more transparent data collection and processing procedures (European Commission, 2018). Informed consent, anonymization, and secure data storage are now standard requirements for ethical compliance (ESOMAR, 2021).

Third, technological advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of market researchers. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time analytics has enabled more precise targeting, segmentation, and prediction of consumer behavior (Davenport et al., 2020). However, these advancements also present new ethical challenges, particularly regarding algorithmic bias and data security.

Finally, the literature highlights the importance of ongoing professional development and adherence to international guidelines, such as those provided by ESOMAR and the American Marketing Association, to maintain research quality and integrity (ESOMAR, 2021).
