# Literature Review

Market research has evolved significantly over the past decades, driven by advancements in data collection, analytics, and the growing importance of ethical standards (Malhotra & Birks, 2017). Early market research relied on surveys and focus groups, but recent years have seen the integration of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and online behavioral tracking (Hair et al., 2020). These technologies have enabled researchers to gather more granular and real-time data, improving the accuracy and relevance of market insights.

A key theme in the literature is the adoption of mixed-methods research designs, which combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of market phenomena (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Studies show that mixed-methods designs improve the validity and reliability of findings, especially in complex or rapidly changing markets (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010).

Ethical considerations have become increasingly prominent. Issues such as informed consent, data privacy, and responsible use of consumer data are now central to best practice guidelines (ESOMAR, 2021). Regulatory frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have further shaped the ethical landscape, requiring robust data protection and transparent communication with participants (European Commission, 2018).

Despite these advancements, gaps remain. There is ongoing debate about balancing technological innovation with ethical responsibility, particularly as AI and machine learning become more prevalent (Davenport et al., 2020). The literature also highlights a need for ongoing professional development to keep researchers up-to-date with best practices and regulatory requirements.
