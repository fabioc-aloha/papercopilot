# Methods

This review paper uses a qualitative synthesis of recent academic and industry literature to identify and evaluate best practices in market research. Sources were selected based on peer-reviewed journal articles, authoritative textbooks, and guidelines from professional organizations such as ESOMAR and the American Marketing Association, published within the last ten years (ESOMAR, 2021; Malhotra & Birks, 2017). The literature search was conducted using databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on keywords like "market research methodologies," "ethical considerations," and "technological advancements."

Data were extracted and thematically analyzed to identify recurring patterns, methodological innovations, and emerging ethical issues. Regulatory documents, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), were also reviewed to contextualize ethical best practices (European Commission, 2018). The analysis prioritized sources providing empirical evidence or comprehensive reviews of market research practices.

Ethical considerations were addressed by including only sources that adhered to established research ethics and by critically evaluating the ethical implications of new technologies in market research. The synthesis approach ensured that findings were comprehensive and relevant to current academic and professional standards (Creswell & Creswell, 2018).
