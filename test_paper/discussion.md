# Discussion

The findings of this review underscore the dynamic and multifaceted nature of market research. The widespread adoption of mixed-methods designs reflects a recognition that no single approach can fully capture the complexity of modern markets (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). By integrating qualitative and quantitative methods, researchers can triangulate data and enhance the validity of their conclusions.

Ethical considerations have become increasingly prominent, driven by both regulatory requirements and heightened public awareness of data privacy issues (European Commission, 2018). The literature suggests that organizations that prioritize ethical standards not only comply with legal mandates but also build greater trust with consumers (ESOMAR, 2021). However, the rapid pace of technological innovation presents ongoing challenges, particularly in ensuring that new tools are used responsibly and transparently (Davenport et al., 2020).

A notable limitation of the current literature is the relative scarcity of empirical studies evaluating the long-term impact of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, on market research outcomes. Future research should address this gap by conducting longitudinal studies and developing frameworks for the ethical deployment of advanced analytics.
