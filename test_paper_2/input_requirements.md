## Topic
Applied psychology: The importance of controlling the content in the context window of LLMs and Agents to avoid AI cognitive bias.

## Research Question
Does controlling the content in the context window of LLMs and Agents reduce the emergence of AI cognitive bias, analogous to the availability heuristic in human cognition?

## Hypotheses
- H1: LLMs and Agents exhibit cognitive bias when exposed to uncurated or biased context window content, favoring information that is most readily available.
- H2: Implementing controls on the content of the context window reduces the likelihood and severity of AI cognitive bias.
- H3: The pattern of bias in LLMs/Agents parallels the availability heuristic and other cognitive biases observed in human psychology.

## Argument
It is important to control the content in the context window of LLMs and Agents to avoid AI cognitive bias. The concept is that AI may use the information most readily available to come to conclusions without verifying other possibilities, just like humans tend to favor what is familiar to them.

## Research Focus
- Match psychological constructs (e.g., cognitive bias, availability heuristic) to AI behavior in LLMs/Agents.
- Use papers related to agentic AI, A2A, LLMs, and similar research areas.
- Validate the idea of an "AI Cognitive Bias" by drawing parallels to human psychology.
- Collect and analyze empirical evidence to test the hypotheses above.
- Explore and evaluate multiple strategies for controlling the context window, such as:
  - Applying heuristics to select or filter context information
  - Flushing or removing certain information from the context window
  - Storing information in secondary memory or external storage for later retrieval

## Requirements
- Academic paper in applied psychology.
- Argument must be supported by relevant literature from both psychology and AI/LLM research.
- Include clear research question, hypotheses, methodology, discussion, and implications.
- Collect and present empirical evidence to validate or refute the hypotheses.
- All claims must be cited with credible sources.
- Follow repository workflow and style guidelines.
