# Peer Review: AI Cognitive Bugs: Parallels to Human Cognitive Disorders and Mitigation Strategies

## Summary
This paper explores the emergence of cognitive bugs—systematic, recurring reasoning failures—in large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems, drawing parallels to human cognitive disorders. It synthesizes recent literature (2024–2025) and foundational psychological research, introduces the concept of cognitive bugs (including hallucinations, confabulation, delusional reasoning, and digital amnesia), and evaluates mitigation strategies such as heuristic filtering, context flushing, secondary memory storage, and software-based cognitive agents.

## Strengths
- **Novelty and Scope:** The paper moves beyond traditional bias (e.g., confirmation or availability bias) to address a broad spectrum of cognitive issues in AI, including those analogous to human cognitive disorders.
- **Comprehensive Literature Review:** Integrates both recent AI research and classic psychological theories, providing a strong interdisciplinary foundation.
- **Clear Structure:** Follows a logical IMRaD structure, with well-defined sections and a clear research question.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Critically evaluates a range of mitigation strategies, including technical and interdisciplinary approaches.
- **Tables and Appendix:** The appendix provides clear comparative tables and actionable insights for both contributing factors and mitigation strategies.
- **References:** In-text citations are present and all cited works appear in the References section, which is alphabetized and formatted consistently.

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Research Question Consistency:** The research question in the Introduction and Conclusion is well-aligned with the paper’s focus. However, the Results and Discussion sections could more explicitly address cognitive bugs beyond bias (e.g., provide more empirical or theoretical results on confabulation, delusional reasoning, and digital amnesia, not just bias/availability heuristic).
2. **Empirical Evidence for Non-Bias Bugs:** While the Results section provides empirical findings for bias and context window effects, it is lighter on direct empirical evidence for other cognitive bugs (hallucinations, confabulation, delusional reasoning, digital amnesia). Consider adding more detail or citing additional studies for these phenomena if available.
3. **Mitigation Strategies for Each Bug:** The Discussion and Appendix mention mitigation strategies, but the main text could more clearly map specific strategies to each type of cognitive bug (e.g., which strategies are most effective for hallucinations vs. confabulation?).
4. **Ethical and Societal Implications:** The ethical discussion is present but could be expanded, especially regarding the risks to vulnerable users and the societal impact of AI cognitive bugs.
5. **Academic Tone and Flow:** The writing is clear and mostly publication-ready, but a final pass for conciseness and academic tone (removing any conversational phrasing) would further improve quality.
6. **Checklist Completion:** Ensure all items in CHECKLIST.md are marked complete before submission.

## Compliance Checklist
- [x] No mention of workflow, methodology, or template structure in the academic content.
- [x] All in-text citations have corresponding entries in the References section.
- [x] References section is alphabetized and formatted consistently.
- [x] Research question is clearly stated and answered.
- [x] Academic tone and flow are strong, with minor room for improvement.
- [x] All required sections are present and complete.

## Recommendations
- Add more empirical or theoretical detail on cognitive bugs beyond bias in the Results and Discussion sections.
- Map mitigation strategies more explicitly to each cognitive bug in the main text.
- Expand the ethical and societal implications discussion.
- Perform a final language and formatting review for academic polish.
- Complete and review CHECKLIST.md before final submission.

## Publication Readiness
The paper is well-structured, original, and makes a significant interdisciplinary contribution. With minor revisions as suggested above, it will be ready for submission to a peer-reviewed journal in AI, cognitive science, or interdisciplinary technology studies.
